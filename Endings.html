                <p>This ending is achieved by not killing Caracass and not giving the gun to Purnell. Due to his untrust
                    toward
                    the
                    Doctor, his therapy fails and he concludes that life is meaningless and grows resentful toward the
                    world
                    around
                    him. In a blind and selfish rage, he attempts to murder everyone in sight; including Sophie and
                    Doctor
                    Purnell.
                    Before committing suicide, he leaves a sour note describing his hatred for everything around him,
                    and that
                    if it
                    weren't for his disability he'd kill more people. </p>

                <p> Achieved by not killing Caracass and giving the gun to Purnell, Simon gives in to Purnell's support
                    but
                    deems it
                    futile, and that life is pointless. Unable to move past the rejection he endured, he murders his
                    love-interest
                    Sophie in spite of her actions. In his suicide note, he thanks Purnell for attempting to help him.

                <p>Achieved by killing Caracass and not giving the gun to Purnell, it is Ending #2 reversed. He forgives
                    Sophie
                    for
                    rejecting him and moves past the situation. He regards Sophie as being the only person to ever truly
                    care
                    about
                    him. During Simon's treatment, his attemp to cope via writing in his book worsens his mental state
                    by
                    "making
                    him realize how broken he was" and murders Purnell for revenge. He leaves a suicide note in a
                    sorrowful tone
                    as
                    to not let anyone show Sophie what he did. </p>

                <p>Achieved by killing Caracass and giving the gun to Purnell, real Simon works against his counterpart
                    in a
                    gunfight before shooting book Simon during the showdown, encapsulating his departure from his
                    visage, and
                    letting go from the stress and trauma. However, during this hallucinatory showdown he shoots and
                    kills two
                    police officers in a PTSD-induced episode. He gets the necessary mental help from Purnell and spends
                    the
                    rest of
                    his life in a
                    mental hospital surrounded by people he loves, with Sophie frequently visiting him. </p>
