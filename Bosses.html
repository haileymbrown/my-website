            <h1>Boss #1 - Sawer</h1>
            <img src="images/sawer.webp" class="boss" alt="sawer boss from cry of fear">
            <p>
                The first boss encountered in the game, found during the nightmarish apartments, may only take damage
                once
                the
                eye on his back is attacked while he is knealing on the ground. The best approaches to defeating him is
                to
                either load up lots of ammo to take him down fast, or dual wield the knife and gun to shoot him down and
                take
                damage with the knife. If Simon gets hit by Sawer, he instantly dies by getting his abdomen severed in
                half.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Boss #2 - Mace</h1>
        <img src="images/mace.webp" class="boss" alt="mace boss from cry of fear">
        <p>
            Mace is encountered after simon watches the doctor flee after torturing and beheading a man for the location
            of
            a key, in which the boss mace has the key and swallows it before the start of the fight. It is suggested
            that
            Mace cannot see, as he stops frequently to find the scent of Simon. Weapons do not work on Mace, as the only
            way
            to defeat him is to turn 1/4 valves to turn the generator on to charge electricty through the flooded room.
            The
            amount of valves it will take to destroy Mace depends on the difficulty set on the game.
        </p>

        <h1>Boss #3 - Carcass</h1>
        <img src="images/carcass.webp" class="boss" alt="carcass from cry of fear">
        <p>
            A particularly important boss for ending outcomes, the ending of the game will depend on how the player
            chooses
            to approach the boss. Simon may either choose to kill this eternally-suspended boss or avoid the fight
            altogether. Before the fight
            commences, Simon's love interest Sophie commits suicide in front of him by jumping off of the skyscraper
            they
            idle on. It is believed that it is a representation of Simon's grief pertaining to his inability to
            walk, in which he states that he feels like "a sitting piece of meat on a chair"
        </p>

        <h1>Reccuring Boss - Sawrunner </h1>
        <img src="images/sawrunner.webp" class="boss" alt="sawrunner from cry of fear">
        <p>
            Sawrunner is easily the most overpowered boss of the entire game with the most health and speed, and not to
            mention that he kills in a single hit.

        <h1>Final Boss [1] - Sick Simon</h1>
        <img src="images/sick-simon.webp" class="boss" alt="sick simon from cry of fear">
        <p>
            This manifestation of real simon may only be encountered in certain endings. In this case, he will be found
            by
            book simon in
            the nightmare realm (his own mind) with psychic abilities after committing suicide. He attacks by levitating
            and
            throwing tems at the player, forcing
            the player to jump and crouch to dodge them. [this of which leads to the bad ending] Sick simon is killed by
            his
            "evil twin" via strangulation. The death
            of sick simon results in book simon collapsing as well, depicting the mental battle he faces against himself
            mentally before committing suicide.
        </p>

        <h1>Final Boss [2] - Book Simon</h1>
        <img src="images/book-simon.webp" class="boss" alt="book simon from cry of fear">
        <p>
            In this ending, the user plays as real simon and faces book simon, who is revealed to be a manifestation of
            Simon's guilt and trauma. Once
            killed, the end cutescene where real Simon survives is commenced. This is the ending where Simon gets mental
            help and copes healthily by writing in his book.
        </p>

        <h1>Final Boss [3] - Doctor Purnell</h1>
        <img src="images/doctor.webp" class="boss" alt="docor purnell from cry of fear">
        <p>
            Depending on the players choice, being if Simon trusts Purnell with the gun or not, Purnell will be
            bludgened to
            death by Simon in his apartment. It is later revealed that Purnell was Simon's real psychiatrist in which
            represented Simon's untrust and fear post-incident.
