            <h2 class="first_step">What is Cry of Fear about?</h2>
            <p>The game Cry of Fear takes place in the perspective of protaganist Simon Henriksson, which takes place in
                Stockholm, Sweden. In the introduction of the game, Simon departs a train commute as he sees a man
                calling
                for help around a corner. Upon further investigation, Simon gets hit by a car and falls unconscious.
                After
                this incident, the rest of the game follows Simon trying to escape the dark and unfamiliar place he has
                been
                brought to. Various monsters/entities continuously attack Simon along his journey.</p>

            <h2 class="first_step">An important and iconic monologue from Simon during the introduction cutscene sets
                the
                game's tone:</h2>

                    like
                    it or if
                    I'm used to it, but I know this; being lonely does things to you. Feeling **** and bitter and angry
                    all
                    the time just... eats away at you...”</em></p>
