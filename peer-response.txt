1. (copy & pasted msg) "Hello Hailey! First off, the gradient of your website is very eye-catching. I like how the gradient is darker on the edge of the screen and brighter toward the middle where the content is. Additionally, I like the different fonts that are used, it gives a creepy theme to your website. You also do a great job keeping your content above the fold and the content of the website is very well written, overall you have a very nice website.
One thing that I would suggest adding is a minimum size to your img tags in your CSS. Your images can get very small and almost impossible to see on smaller resolutions (shown below). This could also be fixed by just making the images generally bigger. Another thing that I think would improve your website is to increase the size of your text (particularly that which is contained in the p tags) as it can become slightly small and difficult to read on higher resolutions, this could be fixed by possibly adding a breakpoint or generally increasing the font size. (Also pictured below) Lastly, I think that the bordered image used on the home page fits into your website very well and that it should be utilized on all images. Additionally, it might look better if it was tighter around the image, this can be fixed by removing/lowering the padding on the image."

I made all of the images bigger altogether as per suggestion of Jacob. I also took his suggestion of making the font size bigger (specifically p tags). My original size for the p tags was 100%, but I went ahead and added an additional 15% increase for a total of 115% for the size. I also went ahead and minimized the padding for the border. After that, I went ahead and added a border to all of my other images across my website to keep it consistent.

The few things that I  would fix are that there is no back-to-top button for the pages that scroll, and the text on the home page on the right side above the monolog os away from the other part of its sentence. But all that stuff can be easily fixed great job I'm too scared to play this game anyways I'm sure it's fun though."
 
 The second thing I improved on was what Ryan mentioned, that I didn't have a "back to top" button on my other subpages that needed it the most! (When I say needed it the most I mean the pages that are actually scrollable, unlike my home page)

 3. (copy & pasted msg) "Hi Hailey! Your website looks great. I love the color theme, I think it fits the topic well. The hover effects on your nav bar are great and your content is concise, clear, and relevant.

I visited your website on mobile first and it looked pretty good. The columns got kind of narrow though, so maybe changing it to just a single column and stacking would let the content take up more space? It wasn't too bad though.

I agree with Jacob that your images get too small to see at a certain point."

I did not even notice this until I read this suggestion. I must have messed up the code at one point because it used to turn into a vertical nav menu after getting smaller at one point. So, after i added my fourth subpage, I went ahead and fixed it. Now I have a vertical nav menu at about 740px i believe!
