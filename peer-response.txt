1. I made all of the images bigger altogether as per suggestion of Jacob. I also took his suggestion of making the font size bigger (specifically p tags). My original size for the p tags was 100%, but I went ahead and added an additional 15% increase for a total of 115% for the size. I also went ahead and minimized the padding for the border. After that, I went ahead and added a border to all of my other images across my website to keep it consistent.
2. The second thing I improved on was what Ryan mentioned, that I didn't have a "back to top" button on my other subpages that needed it the most! (When I say needed it the most I mean the pages that are actually scrollable, unlike my home page)
